"""
To send PCAP files to Kafka brokers via tcpreplay and place them in a topic called "packet topics" on a configurable number of N brokers, 
you can use Python in combination with subprocess to run tcpreplay and the confluent-kafka library to produce messages to Kafka. 
Below is an example of how you can achieve this:

Make sure you have confluent-kafka installed. You can install it using pip:
pip install confluent-kafka


This script does the following:

Configures the number of Kafka brokers (N), the input PCAP file, the Kafka topic name, and the Kafka server addresses.
Uses subprocess to run tcpreplay to send packets from the PCAP file to Kafka.
Waits for a few seconds to allow tcpreplay to send packets.
Initializes a Kafka producer and reads the sent packets from the PCAP file using Scapy.
Produces each packet to the specified Kafka topic.
Please replace the placeholder values in the script with your actual configuration.
